# chatdata

chatdata is a small local bridge to the hosted HasData
ChatGPT MCP server. Give it a prompt, and ChatGPT
answers it anonymously: the reply comes back as
markdown text together with every web source ChatGPT
consulted — each source's domain, page title, snippet,
publication date and thumbnail — plus the links
rendered inside the answer, the conversation title
ChatGPT generated for the exchange, the model that
answered, and a flag for whether a web search was
used at all.

Each call is a fresh conversation with no memory of
earlier ones. The language of the answer follows the
prompt, so write the prompt in the language you want
back, or ask for one explicitly. An optional timezone
pins what words like "today" or "this week" mean for
that call, which matters most for prompts about
recent events — those are the prompts that make
ChatGPT search the web and return sources.

The bridge stores nothing of its own. It serves the
upstream server's tool list locally, exactly as
captured from the live endpoint, and forwards each
tool call upstream, returning the result untouched.
The captured surface is a single read-only query:
there is no write, messaging, or payment tool in it.

## Tools

- `hasdata_chatgpt_chat_getChatgptAnswer` — send one
  prompt to ChatGPT and return its answer with its
  sources. Required: `prompt` (the question or
  instruction, up to 8000 characters). Optional:
  `timezone` (an IANA time zone name such as
  `America/Chicago` or `Europe/Berlin`, setting the
  frame of reference for the current date and time).
  Returns the answer as markdown, the web sources
  consulted, the links inside the answer, the
  generated conversation title, the answering model,
  and whether a web search was used.

## Configuration

- `HASDATA_CHATGPT_MCP_URL` (optional) — override the
  upstream endpoint. Defaults to
  `https://mcp.hasdata.com/mcp?apis=chatgpt`. (The
  override hook is this rebuild's own labelled
  reconstruction.)
- `HASDATA_API_KEY` (optional) — when set, every
  upstream request carries an `x-api-key: <key>`
  header, for the caller's own HasData API key. When
  it is not set, no key header is sent. (The header
  name and the env name are pinned by the original's
  registry record; forwarding the key from this env
  var is a labelled reconstruction — the original
  surface was captured keyless.)

### Forwarding mechanics

On the first tool call the client opens a streamable
HTTP session with the upstream: a JSON-RPC
`initialize` request (protocolVersion `2025-03-26`,
clientInfo name `chatdata`), then a
`notifications/initialized` notification, then the
`tools/call` request carrying the caller's arguments
unchanged. When the upstream answers `initialize`
with an `Mcp-Session-Id` header, that value rides on
every later request of the session, which is reused
for the life of the process. Replies may arrive as
plain JSON or as server-sent events; both are read.

Successful upstream results pass through verbatim,
including any `isError` flag the upstream sets.
Failures — a JSON-RPC error, a non-2xx status, an
unreadable response, or a request that cannot be
completed — come back as an `isError` result whose
text starts with `chatdata error:` (this rendering
is this rebuild's own labelled reconstruction).

## CLI

The tool is also a subcommand taking one JSON
argument string:

```bash
npx @reneturcios/chatdata hasdata_chatgpt_chat_getChatgptAnswer '{"prompt":"What happened in tech today?","timezone":"America/Chicago"}'
npx @reneturcios/chatdata --version
```

Exit codes: `0` on success, `1` on an `isError`
result, `2` on a usage error.

## MCP server

```bash
npx -y @reneturcios/chatdata mcp
```

MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chatdata": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@reneturcios/chatdata", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Docker

```bash
docker run -i ghcr.io/cloudcorprecords/chatdata
docker run --rm ghcr.io/cloudcorprecords/chatdata --version
```

The container's default command is `mcp`, so the first
form is a stdio MCP server; any other arguments reach
the CLI normally.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm run dev
```

The test suite runs entirely against a stubbed
JSON-RPC upstream — no live network calls.
